# StatPadPublicView
This is the public view of my personal NBA website stat-pad.com

Background:
Stat-Pad began as an idea when I first started coding, but it was never envisioned as a website. I simply had a new set of skills and wanted to use it to build something useful and interesting to me. I started it off by having it scrape a website and pull a players points per game. From there, I kept building it until it was a fully functional GUI, and then I had the idea to turn it into a website.
I love basketball and especially love data and analytics, so this project was a fun hobby I created outside of my schoolwork and never intended for it to try to make a profit or even build a resume. I simply just wanted to do it.
